# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This is a Python implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The program allows a user to play against the computer.

## How it Works

1. The game defines three options:
   - **Rock**
   - **Paper**
   - **Scissors**

2. Each option is represented as an ASCII art image stored in the `game_images` list.

3. The user inputs their choice by typing `0` for Rock, `1` for Paper, or `2` for Scissors.

4. The computer randomly selects its choice using the `random.randint` function.

5. The game compares the user’s choice with the computer’s choice and determines the winner based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beat Paper
   - Paper beats Rock



## Features

- User-friendly text-based interface.
- Includes ASCII art for better visual appeal.
- Randomized computer choices ensure unpredictability.
- Clear rules and error handling for invalid inputs.

## How to Run the Game

1. Save the code into a `.py` file, for example, `rock_paper_scissors.py`.
2. Run the file using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the instructions displayed on the console to play.

Enjoy playing Rock, Paper, Scissors!
